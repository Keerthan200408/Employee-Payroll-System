
The Employee Payroll System is a Java application designed to manage and calculate salaries for different types of employees. It features an abstract Employee class, extended by FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee classes. The FullTimeEmployee class has a fixed monthly salary, while PartTimeEmployee calculates salary based on hours worked and an hourly rate.

The core of the application is the PayrollSystem class, which manages a list of employees. It provides methods to add, remove, and display employee details. Employees can be added with their details and calculated salaries stored, removed by ID, and their details displayed on the console.

To run the application, the Main class demonstrates its functionality. It creates instances of FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee, adds them to the payroll system, and displays their details. After removing an employee, the remaining employees' details are displayed. Input includes employee details like name, ID, and salary components, while output is printed to the console showing employee information and calculated salaries.
